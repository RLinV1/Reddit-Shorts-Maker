# How To Use

1. First you have to create a reddit app (https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and
   put the client_secret and client_id in an .env file.

2. Also in that env file include your reddit username and password

3. Next run reddit.py to generate the posts. It currently
   returns the top 10 posts in AMITA.

4. Then run main.py.
   1. You should have 10 txt files in the posts directory and you can either make videos for all of them or pick a specific file name. Also choose a gender for the tts.
   2. The end result will be a directory finished_videos which stores clips less than 60s of reddit posts with each clip in their respective post number directory.


# Installation

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Install ImageMagisk

# Example Video
