# How To Use

1. First you have to create a reddit app (https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and
   put the client_secret and client_id in an .env file.
   
3. Also in that env file include your reddit username and password

4. Next run reddit.py to generate the posts. It currently
   returns the top 10 posts in AMITA.

5. Then run main.py.

6. Then restart the steps again with another file starting with step 3.

# Installation

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Install ImageMagisk 
3. Install aeneas
   1. I used wsl to use aeneas so you would need to use that for it to work on windows
   2. If you use Mac then you might need to alter the code and if you're using windows look up how to enable wsl
   3. On linux everything should work fine. Haven't tested ImageMagisk
